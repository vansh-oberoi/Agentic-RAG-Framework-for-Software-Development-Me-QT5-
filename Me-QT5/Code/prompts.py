def prompt_template(query: str):
    return f"""Break down the following multi-hop question into a sequence of logically connected single-hop questions, following a chronological order. Each single-hop question should progress towards answering the original question, and the final single-hop question should directly address the original query. The step of final single-hop query addressing original query is of utmost importance. The single-hop queries should not be more than 5 in number

Output: Structure your answer in the exact JSON format provided below, replacing placeholders with the actual question breakdown.
